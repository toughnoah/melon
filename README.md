# Melon
This is a project of validating admission webhook for Kubernetes to in memory of melon. The name melon comes from my another naughty fat house cat. Indeed, he had passed few days ago because of bad disease before this projects starts, and he had accompanied me for over four and a half years. 

I am so miss my boy, and I will love him forever.
